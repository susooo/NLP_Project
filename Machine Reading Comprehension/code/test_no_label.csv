it 's a whole new experience and new flavors each time you go .
so disappointing from an old favorite .
it is the most authentic thai in the valley .
do not sign a lease with these people .
i was nervous and she made me feel so comfortable and welcome .
the only thing we received that was hot was the coffee .
"no , not the ones at asu , the ones in junior high ."
they bring it out front for you and are very helpful .
plus the dude did n't even know how to work the computer .
they have an excellent selection of combos to choose from .
they go above and beyond !
at this location the service was terrible .
i ordered a cesar salad with a side of blackened chicken .
very nice location for weekend volleyball tournaments !
one of best veal dishes i 've ever had and reasonable prices .
the food is worse than you find in the freezer section at walmart .
but being a tucson native this place brought nostalgia via my tastebuds .
fun to watch the kitchen in rush hour .
when it came we should have sent it back .
needless to say i will not be back for mexican food .
"stay away , and go to cheesecake instead ."
i highly recommend the ahi tuna .
we both found it overcooked -- and no seasonings .
good selection of parts and accessories and reasonable prices .
my husband had to walk up to the bar to place our wine order .
i 'm still craving my drunken noodles !
everyone that i spoke with was very helpful and kind .
all of my clothes are returned in sparkling condition !
i hate to see what their delivery times are when it 's last call .
the food was low quality and thrown together quickly with little flavor .
"moving past the shape , they were dry and truly tasteless ."
this is an old worn out hotel .
the espresso was way too hot .
"the food was pretty bad , i would not go there again ."
"first , the bartender was an a -- hole ."
do n't waste the trip .
you wo n't find a better selection in scottsdale .
enjoy taking my family here always the freshest sea food .
the rice was cold and hard and the taste was very bland .
"absolutely terrible , do not order from this place ."
ambiance and setting were superb .
one broken thing after another they do n't care to address .
my wife came in for alterations and was treated quite rudely .
absolutely hands down the best dentist office in the east valley !
"parking : no signs or anything , so you just have to guess ."
fun place to catch a game on tv and catch up w/ people .
i suppose id forgotten how bland their offerings really are .
"coupon or not , this place is extra nice and a very good value ."
safe to say we will be going to other walgreens locations from now on .
"she was so patient , kind and understanding ."
the wonton was seriously lacking filling .
food here is also so good !
i was a walk in and got helped right away !
"food good , a plate went a long way ."
the grounds are always very clean .
this place is a must go if you 're a bride to be !
"service fair , pace was bad between courses - long waits ."
"the portions were huge , the food came out hot , fresh and good ."
i enjoy coming here for lunch to get the slices .
"when we get into town , this is the first place we come !"
these two women are professionals .
nice selection of games to play .
they have delicious soups everyday .
this is a rare gem and i am excited to have found it .
i was pleased with their service .
they also found my apartment which is pretty hard to find .
exhibit c : no more student services peeps .
"they were so helpful , kind , and reasonably priced ."
"had it not been so terribly hot , it would have just been inconvenient ."
she was spot on as they were delicious .
well the food was great and the price of it was even better .
the beans were in the burro in the rice was nowhere to be found .
"awesome and fast service , these guys really know their stuff ."
nice for me to go and work and have a great breakfast !
the food is also very good .
avoid if at all possible .
the margaritas were also tasted and the churros with ice cream was also outstanding .
"super friendly staff , quick service and amazing and simple food done right !"
the sushi here is great and i love the cucumber salad .
it was so much not good that i just wanted out of there .
the wine list was the best part .
but the customer service ruins it all for me .
i 've been here several times and every time has been great .
good place for a romantic dinner !
it did n't matter of she is good at all other times .
gammage itself however is not so amazing .
the green chile mac and cheese was incredible !
i do not like the size of the dance floor .
i would rather wait for hot food than have it cold and soggy .
came here with my family .
its quiet and nice people are here .
it is also quite expensive for my taste .
this place is a shit hole with shit service .
had a blast and the food at their restaurant was excellent !
most delicious authentic chinese food !
it was pretty inexpensive and they played good music videos .
my toddler found a dead mouse under one of the seats .
"we 'll see if that happens , but i 'm not holding my breath ."
she was absolutely fantastic and i love what she did !
it 's always busy and the restaurant is very dirty .
took my suite to get fitted and a new button put on it .
"great quality , great service ."
found the place even though it is hard due to bad signage .
the food is always fresh .
the lady at the front desk was not very friendly .
my mom ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box and i ordered the sashimi box .
but their inventory was questionable !
food was alright maybe we should have ordered off the mexican menu .
what a waste of my time and theirs .
food super and well priced .
the firecracker shrimp and duck is also always a winner .
i looked around and there were still customers .
the food here is bland and boring and bad .
"since their visit , the only scorpions we 've seen were dead !"
"only now i 'm really hungry , and really pissed off ."
the food is good and from what i can tell is rather authentic .
sounds good does n't it ?
they wo n't tell you though .
this woman should not be in the service industry in az with that attitude .
maybe they were having a bad night ?
the charge did include miso soup and a small salad .
their small calzone is really gigantic !
plenty to eat and amazing flavor .
she could not and would not explain herself .
the patio is a fun place to sit at 7pm .
"ate kicked ass , marquee , not so much ."
overall really good quality food and service .
bad service in these areas and really ruined our visit .
"firstly , their fees are generally higher than other places ."
"anyway , we got our coffee and will not return to this location ."
"and for this reason , i wo n't return ."
i highly recommend impact auto body .
friendly owners and staff and delicious food !
the wait staff is extremely attractive and friendly !
the bathroom area is nothing special .
"unfortunately , the tour guides are not experts ."
desert followed but nothing special .
i loved the ribs more than the chicken .
the server was n't buying .
great food but horrible staff and very very rude workers !
best take out or eat in sushi !
you 'll have zero appetite after the first bite .
nice wine list at 2x retail rather than the more typical 3x .
but it 's worth seeking out .
save your money & your patience .
the dipping sauce was too sweet too .
there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly .
if you travel a lot do not stay at this hotel .
he did n't even offer another time for me to come in .
travel all around the world and know indian food well .
"even in summer , they have decent patronage ."
"was n't busy , no biggie ."
this place smelt like old urine for some reason .
"the food was mediocre at best , far too greasy and not cooked well ."
service was great as they continued to check on our table .
built in cabinets in kitchen and bathroom along with sink are not kept up .
brittany gave me a very new haircut and transformed me completely .
portions are very generous and food is fantastically flavorful .
is zero stars an option ?
if you are looking to walk out transformed this is your place !
i will be going back and enjoying this great place !
"no call , no nothing ."
best breakfast i had on my recent trip to scottsdale .
just went back to get the rear tire sealed and filled .
"great food , great service , their catering can not be beat ."
i guess she was n't happy that we were asking the prices .
i would never reccomend anyone to live here .
this place is edgy and fun .
this place is beyond a shit hole .
i also get dessert here when i have a sweet tooth .
"i had to box it up even , such a huge portion ."
i asked for thai hot and received very little spice .
"loved the burgers , i had the jalapeo ranch burger it was really tasty ."
homemade tortillas are so good !
"unfortunately , it is the worst ."
will definitely go back and recommend to friends .
dr. hall is so kind and gentle .
green chile chimis are fantastic .
the bread is definitely home made and i could probably eat it all day .
this was the first time i ever cried from a haircut .
they 're nowhere near any fight that breaks out .
"so , it went in the trash ."
"however , the manager came back & told me my order was coming up ."
this piece of shit gave me wonton crackers for my soup .
the overall prices are not competitive with frys .
the service is friendly and attentive .
"and i had my sugar bowl favorite , the top hat sundae !"
"stopped in for lunch , nice wine list , good service ."
the service was great and would gladly go back .
very pleased with service and quality of work .
"she said `` yes , sorry . ''"
"had one mediocre meal and said , `` we 'll try again '' ."
everyone was extremely nice and professional .
this branch is getting worse and worse .
this place is just ok .
great place to go for games with multiple tvs and a lively crowd .
thanks for making our special night an event to remember .
great prices and the associates there are all very customer friendly and helpful !
we were sat right away and every staff member was extremely friendly and happy .
i 'm not one of the corn people .
the ceiling air conditioner in the hallway is very loud .
definitely something i will have again !
i dont know why i was expecting anything different .
this is the perfect date night .
god i love pei wei .
his humor makes a routine visit entertaining .
"`` no , we are going to have a tournament tomorrow ."
i also told him i would leave him some good feedback online .
beautiful scenery and friend staff .
said we could n't sit at the table if we were n't ordering dinner .
i wanted to like this place but it just became a big disappointment .
i was very disappointed with this place .
thank you for a fabulous evening !
my father has decided to upgrade my mothers engagement ring this xmas .
two hours of my life i can never get back .
"you will be helped by all of their friendly advise , and travel knowledge !"
prime rib was fatty and not cooked per requested .
"even the ice cream was very , very run of the mill ."
"pei wei has fair prices , fast service , and wonderful outdoor seating ."
the best bar in town .
stopped by for soda after being at the hobby shop next door .
the rooms are not that nice and the food is not that good either .
plus my sparkling wine flights were delish !
the texture of the meat just looked and tasted wrong .
not so great food and service .
the california burrito was also a great burrito .
i tried to no avail .
"however , it turned out to be nothing like i thought it would ."
my pad thai tasted like thai rice noodles with barbeque sauce .
tried their lasagna and its the best ive ever had .
this is easily the worst greek food i 've had in my life .
not so much these days .
the decor was seriously lacking .
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
we were both so impressed .
everyone who works there is always so happy and friendly .
the new management team is horrible !
very throwback atmosphere ; vintage ice cream parlor .
i skipped eating and we went back to the beer .
"it is a cool place , with lots to see and try ."
"the falafel 's looked like chicken nuggets , and were lacking flavor ."
you can tell how fresh the ingredients are .
the tow package is not an issue either .
so i brought my business elsewhere .
i mean that 's been my experience !
rick is a seriously cool guy !
service was average but could not make up for the poor food and drink .
"anything they say , ask in writing ."
"nope , way way worse ."
they have a fantastic selection and a very knowledgeable staff .
"yes , the portions were large , but size is n't everything ."
great selection of salads and pasta items in the deli .
the food is delicious and plentiful .
they made me feel like i was at home and their an extended family !
my dish was pretty salty and could barely taste the garlic crab .
outstanding persian food not to mention service .
"the game room is a waste of time , energy and money ."
this is a horrible venue .
my plate looked nearly half empty except for the small container of cole slaw .
fun place to go drink beer .
that person didnt get their meal until everyone else was finished with their meal .
i have to say i was truly disappointed .
i called at 6:30 and got the complete brush off .
this is the worst panda express location there is !
pricing is both affordable and reasonable .
it looks old and outdated .
"one was for my dog , and one was for my wife 's dog ."
the food all looked great .
three women met for lunch last friday at elements at the sanctuary .
and every experience has been a positive one .
okay prices and great tastings at least once a month .
staff and the ride were terrific .
very busy but very good service .
their sandwiches were really tasty .
i wish i could give less than one star .
i would recommend dentistry of old town scottsdale to everyone .
"as an arizona native , i have been going to the improv for years ."
"the food was good , steak bites and hummus plate a must ."
talk about false advertising so call before you go !
now it is not so thin and taste like any other pizza place .
they were very friendly and apologetic .
"it 's not my fave , but it 's not awful ."
"if your patio is south facing , you 're out of luck ."
this is my go to neighborhood place .
for a local chain this place is great !
the best mexican food in the phoenix area .
i loved it and will definitely be back !
"so far , great customer service ."
their enchilada sauce perfectly complemented this dish .
i 'm not a fan of huge chain restaurants .
but it is definitely worth the wait .
i had the burger once and it was juicy and very flavorful !
the woman who helped me today was very friendly and knowledgeable .
meanwhile i 'm waiting for an answer .
it is such a cool little place to relax and get swanky .
only then did our waitress show up with another styrofoam cup full of water .
always a great experience there with the owner and the rest of the team .
we 've tried the cream pancakes as well .
if you 're young and are into sports this is the place for you .
i love the food ... however service here is horrible .
it smelled and tasted like yesterday 's oil .
just a frozen patty cooked like a home one .
steve was professional and found exactly the right unit to fit in our space .
either way i would never recommend buying from camping world .
the man did not stop her .
they are all very friendly .
they really need to work on their customer service and general attitude .
and have enjoyed every last bite .
"great food , low prices , and an authentic mexican cantina vibe ."
no wonder these restaurants are closing up all around the valley .
so he can charge a bloody fortune for them .
"i replied , '' um ... no i 'm cool ."
she just grabbed a couple empty dishes and walked off .
the birthday surprise has been ruined as well as her special day .
"good drinks , and good company ."
what the hell are you doing ?
"one of the employees apologized , but it did n't seem very sincere ."
"other than that , i really do n't know what was good about it ."
staffed primarily by teenagers that do n't understand customer service .
i love their fresh juices as well .
they only received one star because you have to provide a rating .
"these guys are top notch , honest and very reasonable ."
"the escargot was delicious , and seasoned perfectly ."
"let me give my opinion , that 's what this site is for ."
"the others ordered the short rib hash , also over-cooked and dry ."
sketchy sketchy sketchy pizza delivery !
"he could n't actually read her pressure , though ."
this is the best yarn store in the metro area .
they are so fresh and yummy .
they will even deliver to the school !
the woman did n't even apologize .
my dr pepper ribs were excellent and very tender .
they have a lot of choices for sushi lovers !
"they are professional , thorough and attentive to our needs ."
this course is one of the finest in the area .
"great food , great decor !"
"fast , friendly and honest service ."
they were extremely friendly and reasonably priced .
excellent knowledgeable dentist and staff !
always good after the river too .
as far as pizza goes this ranks with the best i 've ever eaten .
we loved our day on the river and ca n't wait to go back !
great food and awesome service !
and the fettuccine alfredo is absolutely scrumptious !
the octopus sashimi is my favorite !
"they rush , rush and do n't pay attention to their customers ."
this is one place in scottsdale casual dress is acceptable .
it was my last weekend visiting my folks .
"place was clean and well kept , drinks were reasonably priced ."
the only saving grace was the black beans .
i said it was disgusting to even serve this to diners .
"first time i came in , i knew i just wanted something new ."
do n't go here unless you want to pay for crap .
the message therapist is awesome also .
the staff is awesome and location is right in the heart of old town !
this spot was my favorite indian restaurant .
dropped off my red purse and three pair of black shoes .
we 've been to this long established restaurant many times .
one of my regular spots in scottsdale .
i tried to call repeatedly with no response .
if i had wanted it washed i would have washed it myself !
i took the waiter 's recommendation of the veal carolina and it was super !
i highly recommend this bakery !
we dropped our rental truck of at this location two weeks ago .
the store is dumpy looking and management needs to change .
a great place to watch sports !
"i love this place , the service is always great !"
their pizza is the best i have ever had as well as their ranch !
i did n't know worker there can get tips from customer .
"tires , alignment , brakes and more ."
do not go to this practice they are horrible !
so basically tasted watered down .
the chow mein was very mushy and had weird texture .
"the salads are ok , nothing special ."
the service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average .
blue corn tacos with chicken were excellent .
she did an amazing job on my color and my cut !
he always looks gorgeous and is so happy when i pick him up !
otherwise a great experience and we will go again .
this is the worst walmart neighborhood market out of any of them .
the service was amazing and the staff was very friendly .
"this is a fantastic location , especially because of teresa m !"
my husband and i enjoyed our 3rd anniversary here .
the owner knows us and treats us very well !
but i darn sure could have cooked this one .
the marinara sauce is so flavorful .
i will never purchase another lv bag again .
"it 's not much like an actual irish pub , which is depressing ."
i got a bagel breakfast sandwich and it was delicious !
biscuits and gravy are a great breakfast item too .
it 's a big bowl of sweet happiness .
"and the pizza was cold , greasy , and generally quite awful ."
super tasty and a much better deal than the chain sub joints .
the calzones are awesome and the lunch special they have is perfect .
the staff was nowhere to be found .
my services were very rushed and she did n't even do a good job .
if you 're into that sort of thing stop by and check it out !
our bartender erik took care of my fiance and i very well .
this is by far my favorite pizza .
the good news that my vision had improved made the visit even better .
geez i need to find a source for those uni blocks ... .
there was no personality to our server .
"it is n't terrible , but it is n't very good either ."
"reasonable price , bottom line guaranteed ."
the staff are all super friendly and on top of there jobs .
i highly recommend this shop .
"the eggs are always fluffy , the side of fruit always good ."
"for the record i am a good cook , i use seasoning !"
"our waitress was the best , very accommodating ."
fish tacos were pretty good .
great food recommendations steak and tuna were both great .
i expected so much better from this ny staple .
i just had probably one of the best restaurant experiences i 've ever had .
food is very fresh and amazing !
portions n prices were great !
the sandwich was not that great .
zero complaints with his work .
i definitely recommend this place to others !
we love to come as a family .
went into this location to drop it off .
i love that this is the place in the comic - family circus .
charlie was clean neat and professional .
this is a terrible college .
"i 've eaten here many times , but none as bad as last night ."
i love italian and i eat here often .
got screwed at bar that we made reservations at next door .
it is consistent and the staff is always friendly .
"i do not like to be screwed over , or short changed ."
the biscuits and gravy were good .
the adovada is hot but wonderful and the chocolate bread pudding is amazing .
their steak & salsa burrito was very very good and really big too .
we ate here yesterday for happy hour and it was fantastic .
i have gotten so many dresses at a steal of a price !
the chips and guacamole were excellent too !
executive chefs would walk by not even saying good morning .
i wo n't be ordering again .
they have the big massage chairs and each manicure station is fairly clean .
i highly recommend e & m painting .
will never go back to kfc - they essentially stole from me !
they failed to tell us eating in the bar was an option .
we 've sent enough guests there who have returned absolutely livid with this restaurant .
"hopefully , i do n't take any bed bugs with me ."
there was only meat and bread .
i guess starbucks customer services is only good at some locations .
did n't seem to care about their job .
the menudo here is perfect .
the cash register area was empty and no one was watching the store front .
we went with a group of eight and all had a great time .
my groupon is only for the two windows .
i got the tamale sampler .
certainly a good choice if going to a performing arts center event .
the staff are very friendly and on the ball .
it is the absolute worse place in the valley .
its not cheap but you get good value here .
the salads were fresh and crispy .
this is the best seafood joint in town .
always rude in their tone and always have shitty customer service !
"wonderful staff , wonderful food , excellent prices ."
blue cheese dressing was n't the best by any means .
the problem is nothing was good .
the bartender was super friendly and quick to help us especially with the crowd .
she did offer me a copy if i would like a soda while waiting .
like it 's been in a fridge for a week .
"good food , great prices on wings on tuesdays ."
beautiful decoration and great service .
this is a golf course that is tucked away it is in great condition .
this is the third time they 've messed up that spice .
uneven pieces and falling apart -- i paid for that .
at no cost - great service !
i may make it back to the bar but i will skip the restaurant .
an old dude did my pedicure .
so who do i call to get my money back .
i know i should have sent this back and walk out .
she did not apologize or anything .
i just left this car wash and was very unsatisfied !
i just received a delivery order from them and essentially wasted my money .
"she chose a great color that looks incredible with my skin , too ."
this place is wonderful when you can actually sit outside .
"i highly recommend this salon and the wonderfully talented stylist , angel ."
it 's small yet they make you feel right at home .
i also love their convenient location right off of scottsdale road .
"also , the food is great !"
everyone is always super friendly and helpful .
this place has some great food .
"with that being said , i enjoyed the food ."
myself and family / friends have been going to them for years !
"the salsa is great , the fish top notch , the drinks just excellent ."
the atmosphere was fun and the staff treats you well .
and the cleaning is way over priced .
bottom line they over promise and under deliver .
the pizza is offered without toppings and it 's lacking in flavor .
"tasted really old , i could n't believe it ."
mustard beef ribs are a must .
everything they serve there is wonderful .
the people at sonora were very good to me .
his offer of a `` free dessert '' was even more atrocious .
it is also fun to sit at the bar .
and management does n't do anything about it .
i went to sit down and wait for my order .
the crispy mango fish was very tasty .
"there chips are ok , but their salsa is really bland ."
"new owner , i heard - but i do n't know the details ."
"if i could give less stars , i would ."
the beer was nice and cold !
"the environment was cozy , the servers were friendly and on top of things ."
this place has pissed me off for the last time .
there are no smiles and no customer service .
"seriously though , i have never shopped here ."
i did n't know ra was a chain .
"other than that , food here is pretty gross ."
no massage with my manicure or pedicure .
loved the menu and the drinks .
this golf club is one of the best in my opinion .
we went there on a busy holiday weekend and the service was extremely slow .
this was by far the rudest person i spoke with .
i had the best pork belly here ever !
"sometimes it 's a simple cut , other times is more complicated color ."
it was a great experience !
quality of food is fantastic .
"no , i 'm not at a scottsdale club ."
the guys here are sooo incredibly nice and helpful .
a great museum to visit .
pizza was cooked to perfection and fast !
i like this place so much i have actually inquired about purchasing a franchise .
the restroom was a mess .
had to wait a month to get in .
the drinks were affordable and a good pour .
"french toast plate was good , mom said , but eggs were cold ."
"great prices , great selection ."
i also like the fact that they have fresh squeezed orange juice .
"so , no treatment and no medication to help me deal with my condition ."
"even if i was insanely drunk , i could n't force this pizza down ."
they also have lost sight of what good deli food is .
"the girls are very attractive and really friendly , not pushy at all ."
oh i got my band geek back on now !
extremely attentive and genuinely a good person .
i may just post pictures to prove their shoddy work .
then he proceeded to tell me how to fix it .
everything is fresh and so delicious !
i 'm so happy and will definitely go back for future services .
"amazing food , great service ."
best chicken parmesan i have ever had .
"however , the tech said nothing to me about this ."
"they were great , not too greasy but fluffy and light ."
"heck , even the pizza is decent ."
enjoyed the dolly a lot .
the place was busy but the service was excellent !
by far the best experience i have ever had in a auto shop .
that 's a rare find in a business .
all around great place to grab a drink or two .
you have to sit outside to get the best experience from this place .
our experience with this business was positive .
the bbq salmon was good .
the office also failed to even apologize about this whole horrific experience .
i can honestly say i am so glad we will be moving to az .
so happy with my decision to go here .
wide spectrum of ages and races .
worst customer service i have ever had .
this was the best i have ever had !
you can not pay me to ever shop here !
i was also curious about another product but he straight up walked off .
i love the pork tacos .
all of the food that i had was excellent .
best green corn tamales around .
i ordered the carne asada steak and it was cooked perfectly !
this place is a terrible place to live !
had dinner here last night and it was great .
she kept our drinks full and gave us great food recommendations .
"nice people , prompt service and clearly expert ."
not personalized or warm at all .
but it probably sucks too !
there was no i 'm sorry or how did everything come out .
the wine was very average and the food was even less .
i will definitely go here again !
great place to have some fresh and delicious donuts .
thanks for the perfect repair .
ever since joes has changed hands it 's just gotten worse and worse .
a bit on the noisy side but the fresh food makes up for it .
it looks like blended up chicken put into the shape of grilled pieces .
when the manager finally showed up he was rude and dismissive !
its also not a very clean park .
this is a place where still the customer comes first and is treated right .
"it was embarrassing for all involved , though i do n't think he noticed ."
fun and inexpensive way to enjoy and relax your day .
the door would n't open at all .
"i was not impressed , and would not recommend this place ."
"um , yah , it does n't need replacing just yet ."
we gave it another 5-10 minutes before we got up and left .
when i first came to phx ... yes this sounded indian to me .
a great little spot to throw back a few beers after a rough day .
their cheese i 'm certain was of the string variety .
she did the most amazing job .
fantastic place to see a show as every seat is a great seat !
perhaps bread should be offered at no charge .
"i got there , was seated pretty quickly , and then chose my color ."
"liar , liar , pants on fire ."
not even real brown sauce .
she does n't say anything and just walks away .
the carne asada burrito is awesome !
the queen bed was horrible !
the food is n't too bad but the service is terrible .
the grilled artichokes are wonderful !
"the owner replied , i will go in half with you ."
really enjoyed the beautiful range .
always takes way too long even if you 're the only one there .
"every time i crave mexican food , i go here !"
the equipment is so old and looks dirty .
everything we 've ever ordered here has been great tasting .
they can thank you for the low rating .
food is always amazing no matter what i order .
the variety of sushi rolls makes for a good eating .
you get so much for the price and the food is fresh and delicious .
"it 's hot , cooked perfectly , and delicious !"
these days the quality is pretty lousy .
one of my favorite chinese place to eat !
the only thing i was offered was a free dessert .
i love their flavored coffee .
i think it 's terrible when employees act that way .
service was great and food was even better .
it is a half a day trip from phoenix area .
"crab cakes , salt , no other flavor ."
they are incredibly nice and accommodating .
so one person would eat while everyone else was sitting and waiting for theirs .
this place reminds me of home !
their staff is knowledgeable and informative .
but this place was not economical so the expectation was different .
i love their star design collection .
it shows because on a saturday night there was n't a long wait .
"very crowded , difficult to have a chance to actually have a good time ."
this is pretty darn good pizza !
very good food and service !
"let me tell you , this place was far from busy !"
just left and took it off the bill .
"great place to hang out , grab a meal and a few brews !"
it 's a much better option than the club scene .
would have rated lower if i could .
i signed up for their email and got a coupon .
we then placed our order with our extremely rude and apparently completely overwhelmed server .
"i left hungry and unsatisfied , never again ."
"it was so odd , i asked her if she was joking ?"
they do not stock some of the most common parts .
"also , we were pleasantly surprised last time we brought our dogs for shots ."
what were you going to charge me when i purchase a dozen bagels ?
"food was cold ( still frozen ) , i had the ribs ."
i ca n't believe how inconsiderate this pharmacy is .
and the food is simply not as good as the other locations .
the service was excellent and my hostess was very nice and helpful .
i will not revisit this course as a visitor with limited time to play .
"the most important thing , of course , is the food ."
next dish was moo goo gai pan to which the sauce is the secret .
it was well worth it .
you can not judge people based on appearance .
"overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much ."
staff : very cute and friendly .
we will not be coming back .
you are not the only place in town with decent pizza .
"the menu is very simple , healthy , and tasty ."
everyone is friendly and knowledgeable .
"plus he has amazing prices , how could you not go ?"
his egg sandwiches stink like feet and are slimy .
this place is super yummy !
it tasted like melted plastic and had the same tough consistency .
management no longer cares about the golf experience .
"when it finally came out , it was bad ."
"excellent combination of flavors , very unique ."
i emailed to let them know but they apparently dont care .
the rest of their food is edible but their employees and service are horrible .
so sad but i am not going back any more .
"i had a horrible experience , and i sadly would not come back ."
this place has been making great sushi and sashimi for years .
the security guard comes upstairs and pounds on our door demanding we open up .
"oh , i should not have asked ."
this place is dirty and run down and the service stinks !
i do not recommend anyone to this starbucks .
we will not be using this location again .
horrible job on nails and toes .
great staff and wonderful food .
tzatziki sauce had way too much dill in it .
the evening started out slow .
"i just walked out , called the manager to complain ."
"went back in for adjustment , realized still incorrect ."
grimaldi 's is the most consistently amazing pizza place in arizona .
my jack and coke was seriously lacking .
service was wonderful to match !
the bread was soggy and the dip was inedible .
but unfortunately the rude woman was the one checking us out .
suzanne and her staff were excellent !
there are better happy hours and better beers all around mill !
"casual atmosphere , upscale food ."
the food was so-so and very over priced for what you get .
definitely a must do if you have time in the phoenix area .
too bad it was at the expense of the other customers .
very disappointed and would stay clear of this place .
"ra sushi , you are so blah to me ."
i rate the experience as followed .
"the food 's ok , the service is among the worst i have encountered ."
"we asked how long the wait would be , she said she was unsure ."
it did n't get finished .
"incredible , low price specials and the occasional groupon ."
we sit down and we got some really slow and lazy service .
will bring all my vehicles back for sure !
"when i was finally there , i was very disappointed ."
"furthermore , there is no sausage or bacon on the menu ."
", to name a few shows we have seen here ."
the fried rice was gross and there was a shit load of it .
the mechanics are very amateur as usual .
so you are n't my problem . ''
i 'm stuck in a lease otherwise i would move .
"a steak , shrimp and an enchilada ."
the best deals in the store are on these racks .
so i asked for the card to be refunded .
russ was a well qualified tech .
the place has obviously gone downhill over the years .
great kebab dishes and good service .
perfect spot to shop for gift !
after eating several other gyro place kings still has the best sauce .
"my husband got a ruben sandwich , he loved it ."
"also , could they not bring a single pack of cheese or red peppers ?"
ron is still the greatest .
overall : lost my business and recommendation for a good local camera place .
omg carlsbad tavern is awesome !
she was not happy being there .
the beef taco was good but nothing special .
i will definitely return often !
decent selection of meats and cheeses .
nothing but excellent customer service every time i come here .
the service has always been wonderful .
we did n't leave with anything that day .
"second time , not so good ."
i 'll definitely go back here again .
corn bread was also good !
"now the food , drinks , and desserts are amazing ."
it was just so cute and quaint !
i was n't going to let her do a thing further to me .
cooked to perfection and very flavorful .
love this place and will keep coming back .
definitely a place to keep in mind .
this adds the last little touch to what was already an amazing place .
that comes with the smaller location though .
all in all pretty good !
also the crab wontons rule along with the spicy plum sauce .
this room that he found also reeked of smoke !
all had that satisfying grease flavor that washed down well with beers .
"so , that was my one and only time ordering the benedict there ."
the owner is a hoot and the facility is very accommodating .
the garlic bread was bland and cold .
the green enchiladas were ok but not great .
"it 's basic , traditional , mexican food that is homemade and tastes great ."
"also , the food that is there is n't great even by buffet standards ."
the two gentle men up front are always so kind .
"oh sushi kee , how i love thee !"
thank you ladies for being awesome !
the crew was very friendly and accommodating .
the associates program is no longer an option .
owner : a very rude man .
had to returned one entree because too cold .
i have had a great experience every time from start to finish .
i always have a great dish here to eat .
and i get the gyro sandwich every time and its the best .
the surly older waitress was a huge bummer .
sit at the bar and eat the small plates .
"who knows , it might have been ."
jennifer is great and she really makes skin care affordable .
the only item was able to eat was the soggy broccoli beef !
keep up the amazing service !
"my fault for not looking more closely , i guess ."
this location is super busy and really could use double the staff .
came here to get breakfast and that was the best decision yet .
university is also almost as bad as living on apache .
"when she did n't answer him quickly enough , he hung up on her ."
"simply , there are far superior places to go for sushi ."
"i expected service to be slow that morning , and it was ."
it is way overpriced ( compare to what they serve !
it was over fried and very hard .
"i had to leave a message , and they never called me back ."
"when i complained in a polite way , i was walked out the door ."
"needless to say , i will not be returning to this place ever again ."
this place still kicks ass .
lost a long time customer !
really good service and food .
they loved the rock climb .
it is not really brown rice .
"needless to say , i contacted the store manager directly after leaving ."
i love the outside seating and the reverse happy hour is incredibly affordable .
the chicken chimi i had was absolutely fantastic !
but was very disappointed with what actually arrived .
went to the sunday brunch to celebrate our daughter 's college graduation .
the flourless chocolate cake was one of the best desserts i 've ever had .
pricy but the cheese pies are delicious !
"this place offers solid , delicious take out ."
it is very very family oriented and we loved that too !
"the employees always remember me and my dog , which is very nice ."
"while the menu is simple , what it does offer is truly first-rate ."
ordered the huevos rancheros and it was delicious !
not sure and i do n't care !
this one is not on the ball .
"sadly , i will probably never be able to eat at this place again ."
as soon as they delivered i was like ugh .
did n't even get a response .
overall it was a miserable evening .
"always fresh , fat , and delicious ."
i ordered garlic bread and fettuccine alfredo pasta with vegetables .
try anything on the menu and you will be glad you came in !
i acknowledged this and he went back to take care of the bill .
management does not seem to care .
friendly and welcoming with a fun atmosphere and terrific food .
half of my head was over processed .
"they charged me for work not done , and parts not installed ."
you 'll see why once you get there .
just terrible is all i can say .
great service by the staff .
it was so delicious ; i 've never had anything like it !
it does not take that long to cook sliders !
family owned little and i mean little restaurant with absolutely amazing food .
the meatloaf ( when they have it ) is amazing .
he did not return my call either .
i 'd definitely recommend giving them a try .
so far i 'm not really impressed .
did they not have a fountain machine on site ?
the best part of my thanksgiving dinner by far was sweet cakes pecan pie .
"cleaned my plate , perfect amount of food ."
"friendly folks , delicious authentic bagels , tasty cream cheese ."
i had a spanish omelet was huge and delicious .
had the normal gyro sandwich with their sauce ... very good .
seems pretty high compared to every other thai place .
"this cute little pizza , salad and pasta place in east chandler is great ."
love the afternoon - tea at the phoenician .
"they are super friendly , very helpful , and amazingly quick !"
also matt was super cool and helpful .
"when i picked up the order , i was given another totally different price ."
they 've added some new items on the menu since my last visit .
it 's just too expensive for what you get .
pool tables and inexpensive drinks make this a fun night out !
i 'll keep looking for a different salon .
"however , this experience went pretty smooth ."
"pathetic place , worst food ."
i spent time with my best buds and enjoyed some excellent wine and food .
"safeway has officially lost my business to sprouts , & fresh & easy ."
i 'm sure they must get it right some days but not this day .
"go here , you will love it ."
"i checked online , and the coupon site said my certificate was good ."
do not go here if you are interested in eating good food .
i refused to purchase any of the pictures based on quality .
i love the cornbread appetizer .
i did n't even eat it .
it shows that this restaurant has no class .
"so i ordered my tires online , scheduled an appointment for two days out ."
"the place is small , i 'm sure she could have figured it out ."
"as for the food , never had it ."
their front line is so much cheaper than petsmart !
but it may not actually be in stock anyway .
"thank you fiesta , lunch with you is always good ."
bartender made a great dirty martini !
"we stood there in shock , because we never expected this ."
"lastly but not least , their brownie desert was ... meh ."
salsa is not hot or good .
razz 's failed on every occasion .
if you sit in the bar they have the best bartender in town .
the food is not that authentic .
think twice -- this place is a dump .
"thank you amanda , i will be back !"
"in the long run , they did absolutely nothing for me ."
it was very good to !
no stars is what in want to give .
i 've never had a worse experience than this !
and the seafood enchiladas were great !
he is very thorough and genuinely cares for his customers .
their lunch special is a great value !
"other than that , it 's great !"
super good deals and very friendly staff .
customer service was great there .
no courtesy and their food is pathetic .
"very good brunch , was impressed with selection and quality ."
i have not received such an attitude toward a customer before .
my meal was very satisfying and flavorful .
tonight though i ordered to go and the food was just as good .
one of my favorite places to go for a great steak .
nice club good layout the course was in good to above average shape .
"if i was n't with my coworker , i would 've walked out ."
too bad too because they brew an outstanding beer .
it 's good solid food .
"when i arrived , no one was at the desk ."
i 'm a regular drive-through customer at this location .
what about the time i wasted ?
i would n't go back there again .
giving an extra star for customer service .
included in this price was a credit card fee and an after midnight fee .
in turn my legs are burnt from the noodles and all over the floor .
i just returned from a delightful stay at the camelback .
it is an international delight .
"20-30 % capacity at most , i was the only one in the pool ."
there are much better places for breakfast .
this is a far cry from real new mexican cuisine .
sad what has happened to this sandwich shop .
even their steamed veggies are amazing .
he was both professional and courteous .
prices are a tad high but worth it .
"now the food : not horrible , but below average ."
i reccomend the drunken dragon noodles ( for you spicy lovers ! )
it will stay with you all day .
we will spend our money elsewhere .
love my cut and color and sage is amazing !
they are spacious with modest decor .
the prices were the best and worth it .
even the sides were great .
the staff made us feel very welcome and comfortable .
the beer sauce is lackluster at best .
i will never visit the salon again .
i 'm from the bay area and this was a disappointment and over priced .
but let this story begin at noon today .
she said she 'd be back and disappeared for a few minutes .
"and again , the food is incredibly delicious !"
nothing but happy thoughts from anyone i have sent their way !
i was very sick the night after .
"horrible , horrible , horrible service !"
totally will come back next time i 'm in town .
oj and jeremy did a great job !
service was a little slow to begin with .
i was so disgusted i could not way for the rest of the day .
definitely disappointed that i could not use my birthday gift !
always order the tzatziki sauce with everything you get !
"you can come in , spend any amount of money and enjoy something amazing ."
i got my car detailed here and it looked amazing !
they make a bad name for used car dealers .
this was my first stop in looking for a wedding dress .
the happy hour crowd here can be fun on occasion .
it 's located in a great part of scottsdale and was really accommodating .
the food is great here and very authentic .
"very helpful , hospitable , knowledgeable , and informative ."
my daughter received great care .
"we told them to forget it , we did n't want to wait ."
"actually , just keep walking ."
but it was disgusting and hot in there .
all she did was give me the run around and lied and bs everything .
very friendly staff and manager .
they also are the best price in the area .
the art in the alley behind it is cool too !
nothing that special about this place .
overcooked so badly that it was the consistency of canned tuna fish .
love the vibe of this place !
i should have stuck with sun chinese dining .
the burgers were over cooked to the point the meat was crunchy .
took home the most delicious white pizza since living here in az .
"however , everyone else paid after their nails were completed ."
great lunch specials and awesome staff .
the soup is absolutely to die for .
they are always doing a good job .
the hummus is ridiculously creamy and delicious .
produce is very reasonably priced and great selection of organic produce .
"finally , the cheese crisp was tiny and was anything but crisp ."
were we irritating her or something ?
i 'm not willing to take the chance .
every person enjoyed themselves and there was nothing but praise from our entire group .
even the water tasted horrible .
the service was top notch and the food was a bit of heaven .
prices are just plain retail .
did n't feel like dealing with the restaurants closer to asu .
the thai basil pasta came out lukewarm and spicy .
my `` hot '' sub was cold and the meat was watery .
"if i was the manager , i 'd fire that kid on the spot ."
a great stop if you want nice things at a steal .
well worth searching out this gem .
"oh well , who cares ... right ?"
the salsa was fantastic although next time i will ask for a hotter one .
"it can be pricey , but it is really worth it ."
"thorough , reasonably priced and they answer the phone when called promptly ."
this resort has been in scottsdale forever and it truly knows service .
maria the manager is a horrible person .
"she was getting pissed , and so were we ."
service was just as disappointing .
wendy 's has been know to be cheap with their drink refills for years .
the atmosphere is at the sugar bowl is fun .
chicken fried chicken was dry but the green chili macaroni and cheese was good .
"the service was great , food delicious , and the value impeccable ."
the customer service in this location is great !
they tried to take advantage of me because i am young .
just do n't bother ordering anything if you 're seated .
there is definitely not enough room in that part of the venue .
love their food and their passion .
absolutely ridiculous stay away from this place .
i actually can wait to come back next year !
i definitely will return to the roaring fork !
"love the mole sauce , chips are nice and thick ."
the lunch and dinner items are very good as well .
um ... we just told him that we did n't want to finance .
the sales people here are terrible .
"nice menu , good prices , great service - for both dinner and breakfast !"
i guess even great restaurants have bad days .
the woman who works in the deli is horrible .
this is the reason i will never go back .
we recommend imports & american auto service to everyone we know .
always a fun and friendly atmosphere .
tonight i lost all respect for this company .
they tried real hard to get me to come back but i refused .
the color that she uses on my girlfriend 's hair looks great .
the food here is delicious .
we 'll certainly be back !
the building itself looks abandoned .
if i could give zero stars i def would .
"the beer is n't bad , but the food was less than desirable ."
